# Student-Staff Integration Portal

A web application designed for colleges to facilitate seamless communication between students and staff. The portal provides features for managing student and staff information, assignments, notices, and more, with responsive UI and intuitive navigation.


## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile views with CSS animations for smooth transitions between sections.
- **Student Management**: Comprehensive Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations to manage student data, including profile management, attendance, and academic details.
- **Staff Management**: A dedicated section where staff can view and update information in **Basic Info**, **Assignments**, and **Notices**.
- **Assignment Section**: 
  - Staff can add, edit, or delete multiple assignment entries for different classes.
  - Intuitive hover effects for edit (blue) and delete (red) icons with animations.
  - Create button at the top for adding new assignments, and the form dynamically appears within the same div for smooth editing.
  
 
  
- **Input Validation**: Frontend validation for all forms with error messages for incorrect entries (e.g., “Invalid User ID”) without revealing the format. Toast notifications provide instant feedback on actions.
- **Switchable Content**: JavaScript-based content switching allows users to toggle between sections (Basic Info, Assignment, Notice) seamlessly.
- **Poppins Font Family**: A clean and modern typography style is used throughout the UI for a professional and consistent look.
